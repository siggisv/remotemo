# Default media files

This directory contains two media files, [font_bitmap.png](font_bitmap.png)
and [terminal_screen.png](terminal_screen.png), that are provided for users of
the remoTemo library (Retro Monochrome Text Monitor):
- either as an example and inspiration for their own background and
  font-bitmap texture
- or to be used as they are (with the proper attribution, in accordance with
  their license. Which strictly speaking, does not restrict them to being used
  with this library).

Those two files are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
4.0 International License][cc-by-sa].

## Font-bitmap

The font-bitmap ([font_bitmap.png](font_bitmap.png)) is heavily based on the
font [Anonymous Pro](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro)
by [Mark Simonson](https://www.marksimonson.com/), that is distributed under
the [Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/ofl).

To be sure, that file should be attributed both to the creator of the font and
the creator of the bitmap file:

By [Mark Simonson](https://www.marksimonson.com/) and [Sigurður Sveinn
Halldórsson](https://github.com/siggisv).

## Background

The background texture ([terminal_screen.png](terminal_screen.png)) is by
[Sigurður Sveinn Halldórsson](https://github.com/siggisv).
