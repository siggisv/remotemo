Retro Monochrome Text Monitor - a library for building applications with a
really old school looking user interface.

By old school, we mean late 70s - beginning of the 80s. A fixed size monochrome
text only monitor with keyboard only user input (ASCII only, not even extended ASCII).

## WARNING
This is work-in-progress that has not even reached beta status. Anything might
be changed
