By really old-school, we mean late 70s - beginning of the 80s. A monochrome, fixed size,
text-only monitor with keyboard-only user input (and restricted to ASCII only, not even extended ASCII).

Optionally the text gets displayed at a slow rate to recreate the feeling of being connected over a slow connection.

## WARNING
This is work-in-progress that has not even reached beta status.

Almost nothing works yet and anything might
get changed at any time.
